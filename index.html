                              <p>
                                Alfredo Bowman (also known as Dr Sebi) was born November 26th, 1934 in Illanga, Colon, Honduras.
                                 At the age of 3 Dr. Sebi had an experience that he would never forget. He was playing by the river 
                                 and didn’t realize that the water was too deep and he had to hold on to logs and float to shore. At the 
                                 age of 7 he moved to La Ceiba to live with his grandmother, Mama Hay. She took over the responsibility of 
                                 rearing him.
                              </p>
                              <p>Dr. Sebi started working from the age of 9. He was taking people’s packages and luggage home from the Railroad
                                 Station in Honduras. He would also carry people’s groceries and would be paid a nickel or dime. He continued this
                                  work until the age of 11. At the age of 11 he became a caddy. Dr. Sebi caddied until the age of 13. At the age of 
                                  13 he went to work at a Dairy Farm, which was owned by the Standard Fruit Company in Honduras. Dr. Sebi worked there 
                                  until the age of 14. He left the Dairy Farm and worked in the Commissary of the Standard Fruit Company. He worked there 
                                  until the age of 20.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                In 1954 at the age of 20, Dr. Sebi got the feeling that he had to leave Honduras. Before he left he worked in the Banana Farm 
                                with his mother for about 2 months. He wanted to leave Honduras and go to Africa. In 1954 there was a general strike in Central
                                 America this prevented him from reaching his grandmother in La Ceiba, he couldn’t wait for the Railroad to reestablish so he decided 
                                 to walk from Ocote a Banana Town to Olanchito. Then from Olanchito to La Ceiba.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                Dr. Sebi was accompanied by 2 friends whom he convinced to walk with him to La Ceiba. The journey took 2 ½ days for them to reach Mama 
                                Hay in La Ceiba. When he reached La Ceiba Mama Hay told him that a man came by and left money for him to get his passport in San Pedro 
                                Sula and then they would take him to the states. Dr. Sebi arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana USA in 1954. There he got married and had 3 
                                children. Dr. Sebi decided to be a s merchant seaman. He was a seaman for 10 years.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>
                                During his time as a seaman he traveled around the world to places like Africa, South America, Europe, and Asia. There he met different 
                                people and cultures and learn how to interact with different ethnic groups and nationalities. During his time as a seaman he became an 
                                apprentice to the Steam engineer. A position he held until he left the ocean. Then Dr. Sebi worked as a steam engineer at the Mck Hospital 
                                in Los Angeles for 10 years. During the that time he started researching plants because he was sick with asthma, diabetes, impotence and was 
                                wearing glasses. He was also over-weight. In 1962 he found himself in an Asylom in New Jersey. Dr. Sebi went to many physicians to get healed 
                                but to no avail he kept getting sicker. He went to a urologist, endocrinologist, the internist, and general practitioner. He got fed up and felt 
                                that there was no hope for him. A friend of Dr. Sebi from New Orleans called him and told him about an herbalist in Quina Vaca, Mexico. The herbalist 
                                put him on an herbal diet with juice and water for 94 days. By the end of 94 days he had no manifestations of disease and also lost 89 pounds.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                During his time at the MCK Hospital he used this time to research. He learned that life expresses itself in an environment of PH 7.1 and higher and that 
                                life is not found in an acid environment that is PH 7 and below. Then Dr. Sebi started testing herbs to find out the PH to see which was alkaline (PH 7.1 +) 
                                and which were acidic (PH 7 -). Dr. Sebi began putting compounds together of herbs with a PH of 8+. He started taking the compounds and gruns his friends and 
                                co-workers. The first thing he noticed was that he was going to the bathroom for bowec movements quite often. The people he gave his compounds to where being 
                                cured of their disaster. In 1980 he left the MCK Hospital and started his healing journey. Dr. Sebi moved to Dominica. He was invited by the
